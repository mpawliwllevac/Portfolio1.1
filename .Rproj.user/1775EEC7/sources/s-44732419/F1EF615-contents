I’m a budding data analyst with experience in R for statistical programming, knowledge mobilization, academic publication and presentation of data to people with a non-research background. I also have numerous hobbies including: origami, and board games. Currently my goal is expanding my portfolio. I love looking at the world and using tools like R to help analyze and understand the things around me.

As part of my education I spent time working with a school board where I got my first real taste of applied data science and have since fallen in love with it. I’ve worked with multiple academic labs and the Grand Erie District School Board, assisting in the implementation and analysis of their student census. I’m also very interested in origami and game design.
